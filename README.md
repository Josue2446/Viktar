# Viktar
Viktar program that works just like zip-7 where you can zip and create an archive of files with many features built in!

FLAG options (if multiple option are entered, only last one will be executed): 
  -c (create) given a filename to name to archive
  -x <optional files(s)> (extract all or specify the files)
  -t (short table of contents) given a viktar file archive or input redirection
  -T (long table of contents) given a viktar file archive or input redirection
  -V (validate) validates that the contents of the viktar file archive haven't been changed using crc32 values to check
